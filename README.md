# LoLConfigEditor

## C# &amp; WPF tool to edit LoL game.cfg and PersistedSettings.json more easily.

Having the files on read-only to avoid issues when switching in game accounts makes it annoying to edit settings (in game settings are obviously never saved since I forced the read only).\

This project goals are:
  - Familiarize myself with tools making in C# and WPF environment.
  - <em>Scratch that itch</em> and avoid annoying myself with this little QOL tool
